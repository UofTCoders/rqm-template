Shhh! Secret! I was going to put a detailed guide here, but the honest truth is, I've now found the best way to get data from this course is to go on twitter and say something like "Do you want to suggest some file drawer data for a student project in RQM class? Contact me! What you get out of it: 3-5 super keen grad students interested in pushing your abandoned project forward into a simple pub!" And the data just appears. People want to share their lesser-used data, especially if they can work with you and be a co-author on resultant pubs. It's a highly effective data acquisition strategy. In the second offering, I had twice as many data sets at needed for my four groups of students. :)
